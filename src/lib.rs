//! `ocelot` is an oblivious transfer (+ extension) library written in rust.
//!
//! `ocelot` exposes oblivious transfer (OT) through two traits:
//! `ObliviousTransferSender` and `ObliviousTransferReceiver`. Each trait has an
//! `init` function, which runs any one-time initialization (e.g., for OT
//! extension this corresponds to the running of the base OTs). The traits then
//! have either a `send` or `receive` method, which runs the OT sender or
//! receiver, respectively. This method can be run multiple times, allowing one
//! to for example run OT extension multiple times without having to re-do the
//! initialization phase.
//!
//! `ocelot` also supports correlated OT and random OT through the
//! `CorrelatedObliviousTransferSender/Receiver` and
//! `RandomObliviousTransferSender/Receiver` traits.
//!
//! **THIS IS STILL VERY MUCH RESEARCH CODE**, for now.
