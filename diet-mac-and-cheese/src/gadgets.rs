//! This module contains a collection of circuit gadgets.
//!
//! A circuit gadget implements some computation over a (possibly
//! type-constrained) [`BackendT`]. Each gadget is encapsulated in a trait to
//! allow reusing the gadget between both the prover and the verifier.
//!
//! To "enable" a gadget for a particular implementation of [`BackendT`], add
//! the appropriate `impl GadgetName for Backend`.
//!
//! Note! A significant limitation of this design is when we need to
//! "specialize" a gadget to a particular field. For example, we need a
//! specialized gadget for a permutation check on [`F2`]. This is not possible
//! with the current design, so for something like [`F2`] we need to revert to
//! the old "copy-the-code-between-the-prover-and-verifier" approach, which is
//! not ideal. A potential fix for this is to move to using a `Party` trait
//! instead of having separate `Prover` and `Verifier` implementations. However,
//! this is a much larger refactor, and will take time. So for now, if we need
//! specialization, we copy-and-paste.
