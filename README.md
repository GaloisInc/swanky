# **swanky**: A suite of rust libraries for secure multi-party computation

**swanky** provides a suite of rust libraries for doing secure multi-party
computation (MPC).

![library diagram](diagram.png)

* **fancy-garbling**: Boolean and arithmetic garbled circuits.
  * **twopac**: Two-party garbled-circuit-based secure computation.
* **ocelot**: Oblivious transfer and oblivious PRFs.
* **popsicle**: Private-set intersection.
* **scuttlebutt**: Core MPC-related primitives used by various **swanky**
  libraries.

# A Note on Security

**swanky** is currently considered **prototype** software. Do not deploy it in
production, or trust it with sensitive data.

# INTERSTELLAR WIP

- build: `cargo test --features=serde1,unix_channel,track_channel,sync_channel,curve25519,rand_aes,nightly,std,hash_aes,parser`
  - FAIL: good amount of work done but still not working
- `fancy-garling` OK? `cargo test -p fancy-garbling --features=serde1,nightly,std,parser`
  - compiles OK but some tests FAIL
