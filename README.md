# `swanky`: A suite of rust libraries for secure computation

`swanky` provides a suite of rust libraries for doing secure computation.

* `bristol-fashion`: A parser for Bristol Fashion circuits.
* `fancy-garbling`: Boolean and arithmetic garbled circuits.
  * `twopac`: Two-party garbled-circuit-based secure computation.
* `humidor`: Implementation of the Ligero zero knowledge proof system.
* `keyed_arena`: Bump allocator which allows for random access to its allocations.
* `inferno`: An implementation of the Limbo zero-knowledge proof system.
* `ocelot`: Oblivious transfer and oblivious PRFs.
* `popsicle`: Private-set intersection.
* `scuttlebutt`: Core primitives used by other `swanky` crates.
* `simple-arith-circuit`: Simple flat arithmetic circuit representation.
* `swanky-field`: Definitions of the core `FiniteField` and `FiniteRing` traits
* `swanky-field-binary`: Binary (extension) finite fields
* `swanky-field-f61p`: The finite field for the 61-bit mersenne prime
* `swanky-field-ff-primes`: Arithmetic fields of prime order larger than 64
* `swanky-field-fft`: Utilities for performing FFTs on fields
* `swanky-field-test`: Utilities for testing that finite field implementations are correct
* `swanky-generic-array`: Utilities to make it easier to use generic arrays from the `generic-array` crate
* `swanky-serialization`: Traits and utilities for compact serialization into a canonical byte representation

# A note on security

`swanky` is currently considered **prototype** software. Do not deploy it in
production, or trust it with sensitive data.

# Using `swanky`
## Preferred Way
The preferred way to use `swanky` is to fork this monorepo, and add your code
to your fork. This approach makes it easy for your code to inherit the
configuration of the `swanky` repo.

## Alternative Way
It is also possible to use `swanky` as traditional Rust crates. The downside of
this approach is that you won't automatically get the configuration of the
`swanky` repo. `swanky` is _only_ tested against the pinned rust version in the
repository and the pinned dependency versions.

To use a `swanky` crate in your project, add the following line to the
`[dependencies]` entry in `Cargo.toml`:
```
<crate-name> = { git = "https://github.com/GaloisInc/swanky", rev = "xxxxxx" }
```
where `<crate-name>` is one of the crates listed above and `rev` is the
particular revision to use.

Note: As `swanky` is currently considered prototype software, it is best to pin
a particular revision of `swanky`, as there is no guarantee that future versions
of `swanky` will maintain backwards compatibility.

It is also advisable to copy over swanky's `.cargo/config` file, and to enable
LTO in your release builds (`lto = true` in your `Cargo.toml` file).
