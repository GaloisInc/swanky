**2024-02-09** Projection gates in arithmetic garbled circuits have [a proven security vulnerability](https://github.com/defund/ctf/tree/master/dicectf-quals-2024/dicenet/solve) in their design. The issue affects the fancy-garbling library and its dependencies (including popsicle).
We are currently investigating the impact this bug has on Arithmetic Garbling (CRT) in swanky.

# A note on security

`swanky` is currently **research** software. Do not deploy it in production, or trust
it with sensitive data.

Please reach out to us at <swanky@galois.com> if you're interested in using Swanky in a production setting.

# Using `swanky`
## Preferred Way
The preferred way to use `swanky` is to fork this monorepo, and add your code
to your fork. This approach makes it easy for your code to inherit the
configuration of the `swanky` repo.

## Alternative Way
It is also possible to use `swanky` as traditional Rust crates. The downside of
this approach is that you won't automatically get the configuration of the
`swanky` repo. `swanky` is _only_ tested against the pinned rust version in the
repository and the pinned dependency versions.

To use a `swanky` crate in your project, add the following line to the
`[dependencies]` entry in `Cargo.toml`:
```
<crate-name> = { git = "https://github.com/GaloisInc/swanky", rev = "xxxxxx" }
```
where `<crate-name>` is one of the crates listed above and `rev` is the
particular revision to use.

Note: As `swanky` is currently considered prototype software, it is best to pin
a particular revision of `swanky`, as there is no guarantee that future versions
of `swanky` will maintain backwards compatibility.

It is also advisable to copy over swanky's `.cargo/config` file, and to enable
LTO in your release builds (`lto = true` in your `Cargo.toml` file).

# Software Requirements

To compile Swanky, you should install and use Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). The swanky repo will direct rustup to use the correct version of Rust.

The `./swanky` tool automates some tasks in the codebase. For example, `./swanky lint` will run the Swanky linting checks. In order to use this tool, you need to [install the Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download). You'll also need a python3 installation (no packages other than the standard library are required).
